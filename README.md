### GenealogyGuru Development Report

Welcome to the Genealogy Guru's documentation pages!

This page contains information about the product (or mini-app or module), organized by discipline (as per the Rational Unified Process), from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions:

- Business Modeling
  - Product Vision
  - Elevator Pitch
- Requirements
  - User Stories
  - Domain Model
- Architecture and Design
  - Logical Architecture
  - Physical Architecture
  - Vertical Prototype

We hope to open up contributions in all areas and topics—including requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.—so that the community can contribute in its entirety. Up to this point, contributions have only been made by the original team.

Thank you!

Bruno Fernandes, Daniel Dória, Diana Martins, Ricardo Vieira and Vasco Oliveira
